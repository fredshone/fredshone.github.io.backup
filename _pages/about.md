🎒 I'm at **UCL**'s Behaviour & Infrastructure Group ([BIG](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/civil-environmental-geomatic-engineering/research/groups-centres-and-sections/behaviour-infrastructure-group)). I'm working on tools for helping humanity make better infrastructure and policy decisions. Technically I'm using **Generative Models** and **Reinforcement Learning** to model millions of **perfectly imperfect** people. In practice, I'm enabling modelling of **complex human systems** - such as for an efficient and fair transition to electric vehicles.

🤙🏻 I'm open to temporary and part-time work ([cv](/assets/pdf/FShone.pdf)) ([email me](mailto:fredjshone@gmail.com)). 

👷🏻 I like to build things. I am the author of [pam](https://github.com/arup-group/pam) - a python library for activity-based model development. Pam is published in [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.06097). Pam was originally built to help transport modellers respond to the pandemic ([medium](https://medium.com/arupcitymodelling/pandemic-activity-modifier-intro-3d2dccbc716e)) ([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3MLi96aisY)).

🚂 I've also build [mc](https://github.com/arup-group/mc) and [elara](https://github.com/arup-group/elara) to help people use (the infamous) [MATSim](https://www.matsim.org/). Check out my [github](https://github.com/fredshone) for current projects.

🤟🏻 I'm very proudly the former Technical Lead for Arup's [City Modelling Lab (CML)](https://www.arup.com/services/digital/city-modelling-lab). Read about their exploits [here](https://medium.com/arupcitymodelling).

🌱 Still reading? Thanks! This site is a place for me to find work, but also keep my sanity (academia is a strange place to be) through (i) connecting with people and (ii) keeping a record of what I'm doing. I like to climb, play ultimate and talk about plants.
