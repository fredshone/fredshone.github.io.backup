I am an *incoming* PhD candidate at UCL's Behaviour and Infrastructure Group ([BIG](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/civil-environmental-geomatic-engineering/research/groups-centres-and-sections/behaviour-infrastructure-group)). My supervisors are Drs [Tim Hillel](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/civil-environmental-geomatic-engineering/people/dr-tim-hillel) and [María Pérez-Ortiz](https://www.mariaperezortiz.com/). I'm also open to temporary and part time work ([email me](mailto:fredjshone@gmail.com)).

I like simulation based approaches for modelling massive human systems - such as the transition to electric vehicles, or more specifically, *how are we gonna charge all these new batteries on wheels?*

I have a background in engineering (soft and civil), economics and policy. But most of all I like to build things. My most formative experience is five years Technical Lead for Arup's [City Modelling Lab (CML)](https://www.arup.com/services/digital/city-modelling-lab). CML started as a scrappy rough and tumble research project, and is now the UKs premier Agent-Based Transport/Energy Modelling outfit (or so i say). You can read about our exploits [here](https://medium.com/arupcitymodelling).


I'm a pretty handy data scientist and software engineer. I am the author of [pam](https://github.com/arup-group/pam), a python tool for working with activity chains. Arup now supports pam - you can watch a fancy corporate video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3MLi96aisY). I've also build [mc](https://github.com/arup-group/mc) and [elara](https://github.com/arup-group/elara) to help people use (the infamous) [MATSim](https://www.matsim.org/).

I can thrash around usefully in a range of languages. I engage in established software engineering practices. *Sometimes* I write tests first.

Still reading? Thanks! This site is a place for me to find work, but also keep my sanity through (i) connecting with people and (ii) keeping a record of what I'm doing (hi mom! - I'm ok). I like to climb, play ultimate and talk about plants.
